      <h3>Kwadwo Badu</h3>
      <p> My name is Kwadwo Badu, Studying Cyber Security with combined Computer Science, So far with this Java course, I really felt like it was a good experience for me because this is actually my first time dealing with this type of programming language even though before then I used to programming using python, visual basic & vb.net. Apart from programming, I'm into music and art designs. I hope that I can use this programming language to better my workflow in other sectors that I am in.</p>

    <h3>Java Game Project: SandyMan</h3>
    <p>
SandyMan is a game that was created by me. The inspiration behind this game was that I wanted to have a similar feel to PAC-Man because when I was a kid, I used to play PAC-Man a lot. This project consists of different classes, methods, Dynamic and Static bodies that are used to create the entire game. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I created several platforms for each level which has its own unique structure. Also, I created a Devil Character, Good Character, Coin Object and Fire Object. The only thing that changes throughout the level is that I changed the Devil Character and their position so that it wouldn't be the same as other levels. Finally, as you play the play and collect the coins, at the end of the game it shows the high score you've earned.
